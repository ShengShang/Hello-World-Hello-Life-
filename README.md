# Hello!World!Hello!Life!
A starting test
Let's adding some irrelevant staff on it frome Branch-test
Maybe it should be test rather than testment
So what is test-ment than test? Let's look up the dictionary
Oh-la, they are totally different! Testment is the contents of the Bible, often used as New Testment or Old Testment.
So, this is a misuse here in the Branch naming
to type easily, i will not type in Caps, all character, I mean, nearly all, shall be in lowercase.
so to test the comparison function, i shall subtract some contents here, also for seeing the color changing
and also modify some contents to see what is the showing in comparison
